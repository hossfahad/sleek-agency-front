- Patients are stuck on hold or never reach a staff member
- Staff time is drained by repetitive tasks: bookings, refills, reminders

## How It Works

**Inbound Call Handling**  
Patient calls your clinic number. Our AI answers with your practice's branding and tone.

**Booking & Calendar Integration**  
AI accesses your calendar or scheduling system to confirm, cancel, or reschedule appointments.

**Refill Routing**  
AI securely collects name, medication, and DOB. Sends structured request to your provider inbox.

**Escalation Logic**  
If patient mentions urgent care, emergencies, or provider-specific inquiries — the call is forwarded or logged for a live callback.

**Secure Messaging**  
Optional follow-ups are sent via email or SMS based on clinic preference.
