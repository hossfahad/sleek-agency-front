Of course. This is an excellent choice for a visually engaging hero section. The animation you've picked is called a "Fibonacci Sphere" and it's created using a special library called **CSS Doodle**.

Here is a simplified, actionable breakdown you can give directly to your designer, "Windsurf," to implement this right next to your hero text.

---

### **Instructions for Windsurf (Your Designer/Developer)**

**Objective:** Add a 3D animated "Fibonacci Sphere" to the hero section, positioned to the right of the main hero text.

This animation requires a small external JavaScript library called `css-doodle` to work. The implementation is straightforward and involves three simple steps.

#### **Step 1: Add the Library to the Website**

Before the closing `` tag in your HTML file, add the following script tag. This only needs to be added once per page.

```html

```

---

#### **Step 2: Place the Animation in the Hero Section (HTML)**

In your hero section, we will use a two-column layout (Flexbox or CSS Grid). The left column will hold our hero text, and the right column will hold the animation.

Place this simple code where you want the sphere to appear:

```html


  

```

Here's an example of the full hero section structure:

#### **Step 3: Style the Sphere and Layout (CSS)**

Add the following CSS to your stylesheet. I have simplified the code from the CodePen and added comments to explain what each part does.

```css
/* --- 1. Hero Section Layout --- */
/* This uses Flexbox to place the text and animation side-by-side */
.hero-section {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center; /* Vertically aligns items to the middle */
  justify-content: space-between; /* Puts space between the items */
  gap: 2rem; /* Adds space between the columns */
  min-height: 80vh; /* Gives the hero section height */
  padding: 0 5%; /* Adds some horizontal padding */
}

.hero-text-content {
  flex-basis: 50%; /* Takes up half the space */
}

.hero-animation-container {
  flex-basis: 50%; /* Takes up the other half */
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}


/* --- 2. The Sphere Animation Styling --- */
/* This targets the  element we added */
#hero-sphere {
  /* This special syntax is for the CSS Doodle library */
  --rule: (
    /* This creates a 360-point grid in a 3D space */
    @grid: 360x1 / 400px;
    @place-cell: center;
    perspective: 1000px;

    /* This defines the size and color of each dot */
    @size: 4px;
    background: #CCCCCC; /* Dot Color - using your brand grey */
    border-radius: 50%;

    /* This is the math to place each dot on the sphere */
    --r: 180; /* Radius of the sphere */
    --Z: calc(1 - @i(2) / @I(-1));
    --t: acos(var(--Z));
    --p: calc(@i() * PI * (3 - sqrt(5)));
    --x: calc(var(--r) * sin(var(--t)) * cos(var(--p)));
    --y: calc(var(--r) * sin(var(--t)) * sin(var(--p)));
    --z: calc(var(--r) * var(--Z));
    transform: translate3d(var(--x), var(--y), var(--z));

    /* This creates the continuous rotation animation */
    animation: rotate-sphere 30s linear infinite;
  );
}

/* This defines the keyframes for the rotation animation */
@keyframes rotate-sphere {
  from { transform: rotateY(0deg); }
  to { transform: rotateY(360deg); }
}

/* --- 3. Mobile Responsiveness --- */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .hero-section {
    flex-direction: column; /* Stacks text and animation vertically */
    text-align: center;
  }
  .hero-animation-container {
    /* Reduce the size of the animation on mobile to save space */
    transform: scale(0.8);
    margin-top: 2rem;
  }
}
```

### **Key Customization Points for Windsurf:**

*   **Dot Color:** Change `background: #CCCCCC;` to any color you want (e.g., your dark green).
*   **Animation Speed:** Change `animation: rotate-sphere 30s linear infinite;` The `30s` is the duration; a smaller number means a faster rotation.
*   **Sphere Size:** You can adjust the size by changing the `@grid` property (e.g., `@grid: 360x1 / 350px;` for a smaller sphere) or by adjusting the `--r` variable.
*   **Dot Size:** Change `@size: 4px;` to make the dots larger or smaller.
